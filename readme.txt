A client area plugin for Photographers


== Description ==
Village Client Area allows you to easily create password protected galleries where you can upload images form your photoshoots in a gallery and share the link with your client.
You can also password protect your client galleries to make sure only they see their images.

*At the moment, for full functionality, Village Client Area relies on ( but does not require ): Advanced Custom Fields Pro and Redux Framework.*

**Quick feature list:**

* Password Protection
* Public Client gallery list with quick search (optional)
* Image Proofing
* Gallery discussions ( commeniting on galleries )
* "Themeable" Plugin API



**A plugin designed for the working photographer:**

This plugin comes with an intuitive image proofing that lets your client mark the images that he/she really likes and a comment area where you and your client can discuss the images.
Village Client Area uses a custom post type that allows you to easily create and manage your client galleries.
There is also a Quick Search option if you decide to create a public page where you display all of your client area galleries (only the featured images and titles are visible, the images themselves can be password protected).
